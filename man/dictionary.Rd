\title{Weight of evidence dictionary}
\usage{
dictionary(.data, outcome, ..., Laplace = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tbl. The data.frame where the variables come from.}

\item{outcome}{The bare name of the outcome variable with exactly 2 distinct values.}

\item{...}{bare names of predictor variables or selectors accepted by \code{dplyr::select()}.}

\item{Laplace}{Default to 1e-6. The \code{pseudocount} parameter of the Laplace Smoothing
estimator. Value to avoid -Inf/Inf from predictor category with only one outcome class.
Set to 0 to allow Inf/-Inf.}
}
\value{
a tibble with summaries and woe for every given predictor variable stacked up.
}
\description{
Builds the woe dictionary of a set of predictor variables upon a given binary outcome.
Convenient to make a woe version of the given set of predictor variables and also to allow
one to tweak some woe values by hand.
}
\details{
You can pass a custom dictionary to \code{step_woe()}. It must have the exactly
the same structure of the output of \code{\link[=dictionary]{dictionary()}}. One easy way to do this
is by tweaking an output returned from it.
